                  <h4 id="Introduction">Introduction to Pets</h4>
                  <p>If you are here, that means you are probably considering getting a pet. While owning a pet is rewarding, be mindful that pet ownership is also a huge responsibility. Here are several important things you should consider before getting a pet.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="CanYouCommit">Can You Commit?</h4>
                  <p>Pet ownership is a long term commitment. Dogs and cats have an average life span of 10-15 years. Would you be able to commit to them for such a long time? Dogs and cats require a lot of attention. If you feel that you can’t devote your time for your pet, getting one is not a wise choice for you. Or perhaps you can choose getting a pet like a fish as they are less time demanding.</p>

                  <h4 id="CanYouAfford">Can You Afford It?</h4>
                  <p>Know your financial condition. Owning a pet can cost you a lot. Food, grooming, toys, veterinary care and treatment are the expenses you can’t avoid if you own a dog or cat. Owning a fish is less costly compared to other pets.</p>

                  <h4 id="Lifestyle">Will Pets Fit In Your Lifestyle?</h4>
                  <p>If you have long working hours, a busy social life and you travel a lot, think twice before you are getting a pet like a dog and a cat. Like I mention before, dogs and cats require attention. They need you to play and interact with them constantly. Solitude can lead to serious behavioural problem. Make sure your pet can accommodate to your lifestyle.</p>

                  <h5 id="Research">Do Research</h5>
                  <p>Do research beforehand on the pet you wish to get. Pet care for instance, require a great deal of knowledge. Grooming, nutrition tips and safety are stuffs you need to know before you get a pet dog or cat.Just google it. You may find tons of information through internet. If you think information from the internet are not reliable, you can always refer to the vet in your commnuity.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="Allergies">Allergies</h5>
                  <p>Make sure you or your family don’t have allergies towards fur and animals. If you are not sure whether you or your children are allergic to cats and dogs, spend time at your friend’s house with a pet to find out.</p>

                  <h5 id="Training">Training</h5>
                  <p>If you are thinking of getting a pet such as cat or dog, pet training (obedience training,behavioural training and etc) is something that you can't miss out. One of the basic training is potty training. There is no single, guarantee method for success in potty training. You have to invest time and effort in it. Dogs for example need to be taught so that they will be well behaved, or they will destroy your house and leave a big mess for you to clean up. Hamsters, rabbits or birds are types of pets that don't require much training.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="Vet">Get A Veterinarian</h5>
                  <p>Almost all pet owners have a veterinarian they can rely on for their pets'medical concern.Veterinarian is first person you should approach when your pet is sick or injured. Veterinarian are also your important source of information about your pet. Find yourself a trustful veterinarian before getting a pet.</p>

                  <p id="Conclusion">No matter what pet you are going to bring home, make sure to treat them well. Though owning a pet cost you time and money, I can assure you that it definitely worth it.</p>
