              <h4 id="IntroductionToDogs">Introduction to Dogs</h4>
              <p>Are you ready to choose the right dog for you? Bringing a new dog into your life is a major decision. First, make sure you are ready for a dog before you start the process. It is also essential that you understand the cost of dog ownership. If you have decided that the time is right, congratulations! Now it is time to figure out what type of dog is right for you.</p>
              <p>There are several factors to consider before you choose a dog. Most importantly, examine your current lifestyle and consider what adjustments you are willing to make for a dog. Look at the needs of your family, especially if you have children, older relatives, or other pets. People with allergies, or those who prefer low-shedding dogs, might want to look into hypoallergenic dog breeds.</p>
              <p>Next, think about the ideal size, energy level, and age of your new dog. Just remember that getting a dog requires a firm commitment to responsible dog ownership. Here are some tips to help you choose the best dog for you and your family.</p>

              <h4 id="FactorsToTakeIntoConsideration">Factors to Take Into Consideration When Choosing a Dog</h4>
              
              <h5 id="Size">Size</h5>
              <p>You may already know you want a little lap dog that you can carry around, or, you might have your heart set on a large or giant dog breed. If you cannot decide, then perhaps a medium sized dog is a good choice.</p>
              <p>Remember that some small dogs are delicate and vulnerable. Being stepped on or mishandled can cause serious injury. Also, little dogs can be much more sensitive to colder temperatures, so be ready to help keep them warm. Don’t forget that dogs need obedience training too! Some little dogs can develop “tough dog” attitudes, seemingly to compensate for their small size. Be sure you are prepared for this possibility.</p>
              <p>Very large dogs need a bit more space to move around. Big, happy dogs with long, whip-like tails need "wagging space" to avoid tail injury or damage to household objects. Another consideration is the expenses: the larger the dog, the more expensive things like dog food, dog supplies, and medical treatments become. Training is also a key factor here. If you get a large or giant breed puppy that is allowed to act like a lap dog when young, he will grow up to walk all over you, literally!</p>

              <h5 id="EnergyLevel">Energy Level</h5>
              <p>You probably already know that some dogs have more energy than others. A dog’s activity level is often determined by breed, but it does not mean you can rely on breed alone to determine how energetic your dog could become. Every dog needs routine exercise, regardless of breed or size, so make sure you can provide this. If you know you can not commit to more than one or two casual walks per day, then you will probably be better off with a lower energy dog, such as a Basset Hound. If you are looking for a dog that can be a jogging partner, agility competitor, or “disc dog,” consider a breed like the Border Collie.</p>
              <p>Be willing to adjust the amount of exercise and attention you give your dog if necessary. A dog that is barking constantly, digging up your yard, destroying your home, or acting out in some other way is most likely in need of extra activities. Many behavior problems are the result of excess energy. Unfortunately, many dogs are given up or even euthanized because of a behavior problem that could have easily been avoided with the proper amount of exercise and attention.</p>
              
              <img src="Lou1.JPG" alt="Rough Collies"></img>

              <h5 id="PhysicalMaintenance">Physical Maintenance</h5>
              <p>Your dog’s appearance has a lot to do with his maintenance needs. All dogs need basic grooming, but certain types need more based on the type of hair coat. If you get a dog with hair that keeps growing, then advanced routine grooming is essential. Most short-haired, smooth-coated dogs are major shedders, so be prepared to do some extra cleaning up. Some grooming tools can help reduce shedding.</p>
              <p>Be aware that dogs with long, floppy ears are more prone to ear infections and require frequent thorough ear cleanings. In addition, certain types of dogs can do a lot of drooling. Many owners of Mastiffs, Bloodhounds, and similar dogs actually carry a “slobber cloth” with them to wipe the drool. If they shake their heads, watch out!</p>
              
              <img src="Lou2.JPG" alt="Rough Collie (Long Haired)"></img>

              <h5 id="Age">Age</h5>
              <p>Puppies require the greatest amount of training and attention, especially over the first six months. Be prepared to dedicate much of your time to housebreaking and raising your new puppy. Your dog will likely have plenty of accidents in the house and will probably chew your furniture and personal belongings. These problems will gradually resolve with dedicated training, but patience is a must. You should also be aware that your puppy might grow up to be different than you expected, especially if you adopt a mixed-breed dog. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just something to keep in mind.</p>
              <p>Adult dogs can be an excellent choice. An adult might be a better choice if you want to have a good idea of the true energy level, attitude, and temperament of your new dog. Just because the dog is an adult does not mean he is trained, so you should still expect some degree of dedicated training at first. Fortunately, many adult dogs have been trained and socialized to some degree and can easily adjust to their new lives in their forever homes.</p>
              <p>Senior dogs should not be forgotten! Welcoming a senior dog into your home can be a wonderful way to bring joy to the golden years of a dog. Unfortunately, senior dogs are less likely to be adopted and often end up living out their lives in shelters or being euthanized. A senior dog can make a wonderful companion if you are looking for a lower energy dog. It is, however, important to know that your senior dog needs special attention, more frequent veterinary check-ups, and is more likely to develop health problems that cost time and money to address. Unlike a puppy or adult dog, you must know that you will not have as many years with your senior dog. If you are willing to accept the responsibilities, consider adopting a senior dog. It can be one of the most compassionate things you can do for these precious creatures.</p>

              <h5 id="Breed">Breed</h5>
              <p>Purebred dogs are undeniably popular. Many people are attracted to a specific dog breed for various reasons. Perhaps you were raised around the breed or have spent a lot of time with the breed in your life. Maybe you really love the way a certain breed looks and acts. Or, you might feel the breed is right for you based on what you have read or heard about the breed. If you want a purebred dog, be sure you thoroughly research the breed. Determine if you are willing to take on potential challenges with temperament, grooming needs, and health problems. Make sure the breed will fit in with your family and lifestyle, including other dogs. Then, be sure to look for a responsible dog breeder.</p>
              <p>Mixed breed dogs can become wonderful additions to your world. The combination of two or more dog breeds can often balance out their personalities and physical characteristics. Just be sure to expect the unexpected, especially if you adopt a “pound puppy.” There is no way of knowing exactly how your puppy will look when grown up, and you cannot really predict health problems. Many experts believe that mixed-breed dogs end up with fewer health problems than purebred dogs. Overall they tend to be good-natured and intelligent. Plus, adopting a mixed-breed dog usually means you are saving that dog from euthanasia or a lonely shelter life!</p>
              
              <h6>Toy</h6>
              <p>Toy breeds most certainly live up to their classification, toy in nature and small in size. Toy breeds have traditionally been bred for companion purposes. However, where it can get confusing with the toy group, is that some traditional herding or working breeds are present (many of them being bred smaller for companionship reasons). So, if you are considering a toy breed, it’s a good idea to research the actual breed and ensure you understand 100% what is required. It’s also good to remember, regardless of size, all dogs need training, and many toy breeds thrive in dog sports and obedience training.</p>
              
              <h6>Terriers</h6>
              <p>The word Terrier comes from the Latin word meaning ‘Earth’, and this is exactly what these wonderful breeds were required to do, go to the ‘Earth’ to flush out vermin and small animals. They have amazing noses and endless energy. They are feisty dogs that do require exercise and breed specific training. They make very loyal loveable companions who, in the right home, can be calm and wonderful dogs. Good breeding is paramount to ensure your pup has the right temperament.</p>
              
              <h6>Gun Dogs</h6>
              <p>Gun Dogs as their name suggests, are a group of dogs that are experts at hunting. They are normally utilised by small game hunters (think ducks) using shotguns. Here you will find your Flushing Spaniels, Setters, Pointing Breeds and Retrievers. So it comes as no surprise that these dogs simply LOVE a good game of fetch and excel at dog sports. Easily trained canines who love the great outdoors and having a good run. Many also thoroughly enjoy a good swim and are masters at it! Great for active families or those who love to get out for a daily run.</p>
              
              <h6>Hounds</h6>
              <p>It’s all about the nose when it comes to Hounds. Again, most in this group share the ancestry trait of hunting and with such an amazing scent detector it’s no surprise why. Some are still utilised today in Police work for their outstanding ability to pick up a scent. However, in saying this, over the years this group has become quite diverse, so like your Toy Breeds, it’s important to research each breed and what is required regarding exercise and care. Some are more sociable than others, most Hounds are scent crazed, so, on lead obedience is a must.</p>
              
              <h6>Working Dogs</h6>
              <p>Working dogs have been bred to perform certain tasks. This can include pulling sleds and guarding. They are very intelligent dogs and thrive on all training. Because of their big nature, thorough obedience training is crucial. Dogs in this group include the German Shepherd and Husky. They are strong, loyal and loving breeds but do require understanding and strong leadership.</p>
              
              <img src="Suze2.JPG" alt="German Shepherd"></img>

              <h6>Utility</h6>
              <p>The breed group is made up of mainly miscellaneous dog breeds and the name ‘utility’ means fitness. As this group is very mixed it is important to research each individual breed to ensure they meet your requirement, be it fitness crazy pooch, to a lazy beach-stroll dog. The group contains some wonderful and very popular breeds including the Boxer and Dobermann. However, most of these dogs are large and will require adequate training and understanding.</p>
              
              <h6>Non-Sporting</h6>
              <p>Again, this group is incredibly diverse, so it is advisable to research each breed for information. Breeds in this group include Boston Terrier and the Great Dane. They are companion animals and don’t be fooled by the non-sporting title. Many of these breeds can do very well at dog sports.</p>
