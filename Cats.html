              <p>Choosing a cat is something you’ll always remember. It’s a fun decision, but also an important one. Your new feline friend will be a part of your life for many years to come, so here are eight tips to assist you in finding your purr-fect match</p>

              <h4 id="TipsForChoosing">Tips For Choosing a Cat</h4>
              
              <h5 id="NarrowDown">Narrow Down Your Search</h5>
              <p>You should learn as much as possible about a cat’s medical history, last veterinary exam and list of vaccinations or other treatments given. You should also know when the next vaccinations are due and whether there are any medical conditions or special needs</p>
              <p>Some adoptable cats have a medical condition that requires medication or other type of special care. These cats can be in otherwise in good health and make just as loving of companions as any other cat, but needs an adopter who’s willing to make sure they get this extra care. If you’re adopting from a shelter or rescue group, ask if there’s a health guarantee. If there is, it should specify in writing who covers any vet costs if a cat becomes ill within a certain amount of time after you take it home. This is also sometimes stated in an adoption contract.</p>

              <h5 id="Background">Ask About A Cat's Background</h5>
              <p>Not only is it interesting to know about the background of a cat you might want to adopt, but it can also help you know how well he or she will adjust to your family and lifestyle. Many cats up for adoption are strays or their history is unknown, but if it is, it’s beneficial to learn about. Questions you can ask include</p>
              <!--List of questions to ask-->
              <ul>
                <li>What is the cat’s history?</li>
                <li>Is it known if he or she gets along with other cats?</li>
                <li>Is it known if he or she gets along with other cats?</li>
                <li>Does the cat get along with dogs?</li>
                <li>Is the cat afraid of dogs?</li>
                <li>Is the cat good with children?</li>

              </ul>
              <p>The more compatible your new pet is with the current residents of your household (including other cats or dogs), the easier the adjustment period will be. Most cats are pretty adaptable, but avoiding potential conflicts is always best. For example, if you have a few dogs, it’s better to choose a cat that has been around dogs and isn’t afraid of them. The person who has been caring for the cat might be able to offer insight on whether they'll be compatible with other pets or children in your home.</p>

              <h5 id="Personality">Choose a Cat with a Compatible Personality</h5>
              <p>Just like people, cats have distinct and dynamic personalities. While observing and interacting with any cats you might want to adopt, notice how they are with you and other cats they’re around. Are they timid, bold, playful, shy, energetic, or calm? Certain personalities may appeal to you more than others, and this can help in making your decision. There are a couple of cat personality types you may notice.</p>
              <!--Another list to be able to easily read the information-->
              <ul>
                <li>Greeter Cats - Some cats are known as "greeters." Felines with this personality will approach anyone, stranger or not, to say hello and get some attention. They’re social and confident, and will probably be like this in your home too. This kind of cat won’t be hiding under your bed when guests visit.</li>
                <li>Shy at First - Other cats are a little harder to get to know at first. They may be very sweet, loving, and friendly cats, but their protective instincts are strong, so they’re more reserved with anyone they don’t know. Once they’re settled in a home and feel comfortable, they come out of their shell and are social with people in the household.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Personality is a personal choice. Whether your ideal cat is a cuddly lap cat or a very energetic one, there's a cat that’s a match for everyone.</p>

              <h5 id="GetToKnowTheCat">Get To Know The Cat</h5>
              <p>If you see a cat you like, ask if you can visit with it outside its cage. Some adoption centers have rooms where you can get acquainted. If this is your first cat, keep in mind that being up for adoption can be scary for them, especially shy ones. They’re in an environment they’re not used to, and this can make even the calmest cats behave differently than they would in a home. As you spend time with a cat, you should be able to tell if there’s a connection and if you can picture him or her in your life.If you’re not sure, keep searching until you find one you’re certain is right.</p>
              
              <h5 id="Intuition">Trust Your Intuition</h5>
              <p>Sometimes you come across a certain cat and just have a feeling it’s the one you’re meant to adopt. It might be one that’s completely different from what you were looking for, but something tells you that this is your new best friend. If everything else seems right, trust your instincts.</p>
              
              <h5 id="LetTheCatChooseYou">Let The Cat Choose You</h5>
              <p>If you're looking for a cat someplace where there are several to choose from, and a certain cat really likes you, your decision will be much easier. You can't go wrong with a cat that likes you from the start.</p>

              <h5 id="Age">Be Open To Cats of All Ages</h5>
              <p>Cats of every age make wonderful pets. With proper care, they can live long, healthy lives. Whether you choose a kitten, adult or senior cat, you’ll have years of love and companionship ahead.</p>
